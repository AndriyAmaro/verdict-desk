# can execute. A page that renders nothing still returns HTTP 200, so a broken page ships silently.
# This serves the site the way GitHub Pages does (web/ plus ledger/ side by side), renders each
# page with real headless Chromium, and asserts on what actually arrived in the DOM.
#
# Requires a Chromium binary. Set CHROME=/path/to/chrome if it is not in a Playwright cache.
