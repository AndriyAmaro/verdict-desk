"""Decision exhibit: one dossier rendered as a document a reviewer can file.

A legal hackathon is judged by people whose instinct is "can I rely on this in a
dispute?". A JSON line is auditable but not presentable; this module turns one dossier
into a self-contained, printable exhibit with four things a filing needs:

  1. what the agent saw, with the source and time of every item (custody);
  2. who argued what, and which claims were refused for lack of a citation;
  3. which single argument decided the outcome (attribution, not narration);
  4. what the record does **not** prove (limits, stated before anyone asks).

The integrity block is recomputed at render time from the dossier body, so an exhibit
generated from a tampered record says so on its face.
